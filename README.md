# VRTK Tutorial
This repository is based off of the current VRTK Master repository, and has been upgraded to Unity 2019.4.1f1 for the use in DIG4633 Multi Modal Design.

## Description

The scene can be found here: Example Scene

Our team built these features:

### Feature 1: <Chicken Collecting: The interactivity here is to grab some chickens & place them into the nearby coop area.>
Team member: <Derrick>

### Feature 2: <Close the Gate: The interactivity here is to close the gate so logically, the chickens won't escape again. I attempted to make it close & open more cleanly but could not.>
Team member: <Derrick>

Also credit to Meshtint for the Toon Chicken prefab.
