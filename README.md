Our team built these features:

### Feature 1: Chicken Collecting: The interactivity here is to grab some chickens & place them into the nearby coop area.
Team member: Derrick

### Feature 2: Close the Gate: The interactivity here is to close the gate so logically, the chickens won't escape again. I attempted to make it close & open more cleanly but could not.
Team member: Derrick

### Feature 3: Paul's Pumpkin - Find the Pumpkin Key for the Door to be delivered to Paul the Scarecrow.
Team member: Clarisse Cockrill 

### Feature 4: Made player able to dismember scarecrow
Team member: Gabriel 

Bugs: We had an issue with merging the files together. We were able to eliminate any known bugs, but our attempt to merge the project together became difficult - we tried to intigrate and merge, but we had conflicts. So - we tried and we recommend looking at each individual branch to see what we did and have fun.
